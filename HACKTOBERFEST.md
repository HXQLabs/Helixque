## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and **clone** your fork locally.  
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix.  
3. Follow the setup guide in the main `README.md` to install dependencies and run both frontend and backend.  
4. Make your changes following the existing project structure and style.  
5. Test your changes thoroughly before committing.  
6. **Commit with clear messages**, push to your fork, and open a **Pull Request** to the `develop` branch.  

Before submitting, ensure your branch is up-to-date with `develop` to avoid merge conflicts.

## ✅ Good Git Practices

- Keep commits **small and meaningful**.  
- Always **reference the issue number** your PR addresses.  
- Use **clear PR titles** and include a brief summary of what was changed.  
- Check that the project **builds successfully** before submitting (`npm run build`).  
- Include **screenshots or short clips** when making UI-related changes.  
- Avoid submitting multiple unrelated changes in one PR.  

Maintainers review each PR carefully - concise, organized contributions are reviewed and merged faster.
