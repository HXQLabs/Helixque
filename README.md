## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omelge-exe/Helixque.git
   cd Helixque
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Development

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server will start on `http://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in PORT env var)

2. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or next available port)

3. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to the frontend URL and allow camera/microphone permissions when prompted.

### Production Build

1. **Build the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Build the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Backend (`/backend/.env`)
```env
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=production
# Optional: Redis configuration for scaling
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

#### Frontend (`/frontend/.env.local`)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

## 🧩 Core Components

### UserManager
Handles user lifecycle, preference-based matching logic, and connection management:
- **Smart Matching**: Maintains preference-based matching system for connecting relevant users
- **Connection Management**: Prevents unwanted reconnections and manages user preferences
- **Connection Tracking**: Monitors online/offline status
- **Professional Networking**: Manages current conversation pairs based on user criteria

### RoomManager  
Manages chat rooms and WebRTC signaling:
- **Room Creation**: Sets up communication channels between users
- **WebRTC Signaling**: Facilitates offer/answer/ICE exchange
- **Teardown**: Cleans up rooms when users leave

### Room Component
Frontend video chat interface:
- **Media Stream Management**: Handles local and remote video/audio
- **WebRTC Peer Connections**: Establishes direct communication
- **UI Controls**: Next, leave, and device toggle buttons
- **Connection States**: Loading, connected, and error states

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Join**: Visit the application and allow camera/microphone access
2. **Setup**: Configure your video/audio preferences and connection criteria
3. **Connect**: Get automatically paired with another user based on your preferences
4. **Chat**: Enjoy real-time professional video conversation
5. **Next**: Click "Next" to find a new conversation partner
6. **Leave**: Click "Leave" to exit the application

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage**: Conversations are private and not recorded or stored
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Video/audio streams directly between users for maximum privacy
- **Temporary Rooms**: Chat rooms are destroyed when users disconnect
- **Preference Management**: Your connection preferences are kept secure and private

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Render/Railway/Heroku)

1. Set the `PORT` environment variable (automatically provided by most platforms)
2. Ensure `NODE_ENV=production`
3. Run `npm run build && npm start`

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel/Netlify)

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to your backend URL
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Deploy the generated `.next` directory

### Docker Deployment

Backend Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist ./dist
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Backend**: Extend `UserManager` or `RoomManager` classes
2. **Frontend**: Add new components in `/components` directory
3. **Real-time Events**: Update Socket.IO event handlers in both backend and frontend

### Testing

```bash
# Backend tests (if available)
cd backend
npm test

# Frontend tests (if available)  
cd frontend
npm test
```
