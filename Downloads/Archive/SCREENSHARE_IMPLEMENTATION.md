# Screenshare Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented participant screenshare logic with separate tracks that reflect on both users' screens.

## Backend Changes (`backend/src/index.ts`)

### Added WebSocket Events:
- `screenshare:offer` - Handle screenshare SDP offers
- `screenshare:answer` - Handle screenshare SDP answers  
- `screenshare:ice-candidate` - Handle screenshare ICE candidates
- `screenshare:track-start` - Notify when screenshare starts
- `screenshare:track-stop` - Notify when screenshare stops
- Enhanced `screen:state` - Existing state management

## Frontend Changes (`my-app/components/RTC/Room.tsx`)

### New State Variables:
- `screenShareOn` - Local screenshare state
- `peerScreenShareOn` - Remote screenshare state

### New Refs:
- `localScreenShareRef` - Local screenshare video element
- `remoteScreenShareRef` - Remote screenshare video element
- `screenShareSenderRef` - WebRTC sender for screenshare track
- `currentScreenShareTrackRef` - Current screenshare track
- `localScreenShareStreamRef` - Local screenshare stream
- `remoteScreenShareStreamRef` - Remote screenshare stream

### Key Features:

#### 1. Screen Share Toggle Function (`toggleScreenShare`)
- Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` for screen capture
- Includes both video and audio (system audio when available)
- Handles track management and WebRTC sender operations
- Automatically detects when user stops sharing via browser controls
- Sends appropriate socket events to notify peer

#### 2. Track Detection and Handling
- Modified `ontrack` handlers in both caller and answerer flows
- Detects screenshare tracks using `displaySurface` property
- Separates screenshare tracks from regular video/audio tracks
- Routes tracks to appropriate video elements

#### 3. UI Components
- **Screenshare Button**: Monitor/MonitorStop icons with blue highlighting when active
- **Local Screenshare Preview**: Top-right overlay when user is sharing
- **Remote Screenshare Display**: Full overlay when peer is sharing screen
- **Visual Indicators**: Blue borders and labels to distinguish screenshare content

#### 4. Event Handling
- Socket listeners for screenshare events
- Proper cleanup on disconnect/leave/next
- State synchronization between peers

#### 5. Stream Management
- Separate MediaStreams for screenshare content
- Proper track stopping and cleanup
- Memory leak prevention

## How It Works

### Starting Screenshare:
1. User clicks screenshare button
2. Browser prompts for screen selection
3. `getDisplayMedia()` captures screen/window/tab
4. Track is added to WebRTC peer connection
5. Socket events notify remote peer
6. Local preview shows in top-right corner

### Receiving Screenshare:
1. Remote peer starts screenshare
2. Track received via `ontrack` event
3. Track detected as screenshare using `displaySurface`
4. Stream routed to remote screenshare video element
5. Full overlay displays peer's screen
6. State updated to show screenshare is active

### Stopping Screenshare:
1. User clicks stop button OR browser "Stop sharing" button
2. All screenshare tracks stopped
3. WebRTC sender removed
4. Socket events notify remote peer
5. UI returns to normal state
6. All screenshare streams cleaned up

## Testing Instructions

1. Start both backend and frontend servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd backend && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2  
   cd my-app && npm run dev
   ```

2. Open two browser windows/tabs to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Enter different names and wait for matching

4. Once connected, click the Monitor icon to start screenshare

5. The screenshare should appear on both users' screens:
   - Sharing user sees preview in top-right
   - Receiving user sees full overlay of shared screen

6. Click MonitorStop icon or browser "Stop sharing" to end screenshare

## Key Benefits

- **Separate Track Management**: Screenshare uses dedicated tracks, independent of camera/mic
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Both users see screenshare immediately 
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper resource management prevents memory leaks
- **Browser Integration**: Works with native browser screenshare controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear UI indicators show screenshare state
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for permission denied, etc.

The implementation provides a complete screenshare solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing video chat functionality.
