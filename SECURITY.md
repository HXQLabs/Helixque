# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, use GitHubâ€™s **private vulnerability reporting feature** to notify the maintainers securely:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Report a vulnerability](../../security/advisories/new)

If this option is unavailable, you can alternatively describe the issue privately to the maintainer team via GitHub (e.g., through a private message or organization contact).

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will respond as soon as possible.

## Supported Versions
Only the latest stable release of this project is supported for security updates.

## Responsible Disclosure
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- Steps to reproduce the issue  
- The potential impact  
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
